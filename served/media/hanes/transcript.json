It was a place where they had lived most all of their married life. It was a changing neighborhood, mixed races throughout. I went the front door, and it was one of those clear, rare, low humidity Birmingham days, in the 70s maybe. The front door was open, but the screen was shut, and I could see it was dark inside. I rapped on the screen. I could hear this faint little voice, \"Who is it?\" I said, \"Miss Tee, it's Art.\" \"Come in.\" And I opened the screen, and I stepped into their little living room. It was a small little two bedroom house in North Birmingham. She was lying there on the sofa and, I don't know, maybe I read too much great literature at Princeton, but I had these pictures in my mind. I could see the dust motes floating through the slanting rays of sunlight, the few that were filtering into the room. It was cool, and she was lying there on the sofa. As a Southern lady you will appreciate the phrase, \"As if she had the vapors.\"",

I'm not making that analogy more than it is, but that's the kind of dramatic change, a massive societal change is what you were dealing with. It took thought and differing approaches to it. There were some people like Bull Connor who was not a person of good will. It couldn't happen. He would fall in a category with the J. B. Stoners, and the Asa Carters, and Ed Fields, and the intractable people. Of course, my view of all of that is that you're talking maybe within a generation, and that was a radical change, and it is a radical change. It seems to me that as long as people are making a living and gaining attention on the issue that it will remain an issue. Morris Dees in Montgomery is a good example. Reverend Jesse Jackson is a good example. As long as there is a living to be made of fighting a fight, ostensibly on both sides, then there will be people doing it. Until we get to the point where the leadership, where the people my age are gone, segregation to me wasn't part of my life really. What they call the \"N\" word now as never allowed in my house, for instance. That was an impolite way to speak. That was not allowed. But other than that, I just went about my business. I just didn't think about it. It just wasn't part of my life. I think, however, if I were my age and I had been segregated until I was twenty-two years old I doubt that I would forget it. I have a lot of friends who were segregated for their lifetime, and they have a lot of equanimity, but it's a different memory. It's a different approach to it. I think we've got to have the generations who remember living in a segregated society in the South for it to pass into history completely is my opinion of it. That was a digression.
